# Demos

Curated runnable showcases — one file per feature. Each demo exercises
one capability in isolation so we (and anyone reading the codebase) can
see it work end-to-end. The full e-commerce diagram in `architecture.py`
doubles as the quickstart.

For every demo, this folder ships:

- `<name>.py` — the source (the canonical artefact).
- `html/<name>.html` — a CDN-rendered interactive copy (~10–25 KB).
  Open in any browser with internet to pan / zoom the diagram.
- `img/<name>.png` — a static preview embedded below so GitHub shows
  the diagram without anyone having to run or download anything.

## How to run / regenerate

```bash
python docs/demos/<name>.py
```

The committed `html/` and `img/` artefacts are pre-generated; running
the script locally produces a fresh `.html` you can throw away.

## architecture — full e-commerce C4-container view

`SystemMap` with 16 components, 5 layers, 19 connections. Stresses
layout (Sugiyama), routing (A\* with congestion / overlap avoidance),
off-page connectors, and group swim-lanes.

## tree — top-down hierarchy via TreeMap

Org chart with 13 nodes. Reingold-Tilford layout: each subtree gets the
horizontal width its leaves need; parents centre over children.

## multi_view — Architecture Description split into focused views

The same e-commerce system as two separate views (`storefront`,
`payments`). A `connect()` from one view's component to another's
becomes an auto-detected stub (dashed/faded box) in the secondary view.

## qualities — ISO 25010 quality badges

Components and connections carry typed quality attributes. The renderer
shows coloured letter badges for any quality with `criticality` of
`high` or `critical`. Colour key: S=security, P=performance,
R=reliability, M=maintainability, etc. (see
[`../ontology/qualities.md`](../ontology/qualities.md)).

## trace_matrix — trace links as both overlay and table

Trace links are SysML-vocabulary semantic edges across models
(`realizes`, `depends_on`, `documents`, …). sysatlas renders them in
two ways: dashed purple **overlay edges** inside each view (they don't
enter the Sugiyama layout) and a standalone **HTML matrix** for
audit-style review.

## sequence — UML sequence diagram via SequenceMap

Eight messages across five actors (User/Web/Orders/Fraud/DB). Vertical
lifelines, activations on each actor, and an `opt` frame wrapping the
fraud-check branch. Reply messages render as dashed arrows.

## er — Entity-Relationship diagram via ERMap

Four-entity e-commerce schema (Customer, Order, LineItem, Product).
LineItem is marked as a weak entity (yellow header, bolder border).
Keys are marked with a key glyph; required attributes with a filled
dot. Each relationship line carries source/target cardinality and a
verb-phrase label.

## state_machine — state chart via StateMap

Order-lifecycle state machine: Pending → Paid → Shipped → Delivered,
with a Cancelled side-branch. Initial pseudo-state is a filled circle;
final is a bullseye. Each state carries optional `entry/do/exit`
actions, and transitions render as `event [guard] / action`.

## hub — hub-and-spoke strategy (read/write loops around an integrating model)

Drop the Sugiyama stack: `strategy="hub"` places one central component
("hub") with consumers stacked on the right, sources on the left,
interfaces on top, and external systems at the bottom. Five reserved
layer names drive placement (`interfaces`, `write`, `hub`, `read`,
`external`). See
[`../ontology/architecture.md`](../ontology/architecture.md#layout-strategy).
